Key Enhancements:
Modularity: Separated the game into different classes (Snake, Food, and Game) and a configuration file (config.py).
Maintainability: Constants are stored in config.py for easy adjustments. Game logic is now encapsulated within the Game class.
Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling for file operations (like loading and saving high scores).
Improved Structure: The Game class handles the main loop, game states, and transitions, making the code more organized.
Reusability: The Snake and Food classes can be reused or extended for other projects.
This refactored code should be more maintainable, easier to understand, and ready for further enhancements or features.
